task 1 - interpreter translates one statement from the program one at a time whereas a compiler translates the entire program at once

task 2 - the rules for creating variables are - a variable canonot start with special charecters like comma, underscore, semicolon etc
  - there should not be spaces in the variables
  -you cannot start the variable with a number
  -variables are case sensitive (Python and python are different)

task 3 - in python 2 "print" is treated as a statement rather than a function
  -when you divide in python 2 the answer you get is always a whole number which could lead to problems (ex:3/2=1)

task 4 - Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part

task 5 - prime number - prime numbers are numbers which cannot be divided by any number other than 1 annd the number itself
       - factorial - The factorial is found for a number by multiplying all the integers starting from 1 till the given number
       - fibonacci series - the fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting from 0 which are the sumof the previous 2 numbers
       -armstrong number -  armstrong number is the sum of the cubes of its digits
       -odd numbers - odd numbers are numbers which cannot be devided by 2
       -even numbers - even numbers are numbers which can be divided by 2
       -positive numbers - positive numbers are numbers which come after 0
       -negative numbers  negative numbers are numbers which come before 0
       -complex numbers - Complex numbers are numbers that consist of two parts â€” a real number and an imaginary number
       -palindrome - A word, number, phrase or a set of characters which are the same when read from forwards or backwords
       -anagram - an anagram is a string similiar to another string except the charecters are in a different order
